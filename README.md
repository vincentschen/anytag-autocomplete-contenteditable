#Bootstrap (Any) Tag Autocomplete

This is a bootstrap plugin to autocomplete tags for contenteditable div elements. It works in the same way tagging people on Facebook, Twitter or Sandglaz works. 

Allows user to set any string as the inline tag (rather than only one character) to prompt autocomplete.
